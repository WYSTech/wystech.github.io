    <h1>Death Valley National Park</h1>
    <p>Death Valley National Park is an American national park that straddles the California – Nevada border, east of the Sierra Nevada[^1^][13]. The park boundaries include Death Valley, the northern section of Panamint Valley, the southern section of Eureka Valley, and most of Saline Valley[^1^][13]. The park occupies an interface zone between the arid Great Basin and Mojave deserts, protecting the northwest corner of the Mojave Desert and its diverse environment of salt-flats, sand dunes, badlands, valleys, canyons, and mountains[^1^][13].</p>

    <h2>Location and History</h2>
    <p>Death Valley is a desert valley in Eastern California, in the northern Mojave Desert, bordering the Great Basin Desert[^2^][8]. It is the largest national park in the contiguous United States, as well as the hottest, driest and lowest of all the national parks in the United States[^1^][13]. It contains Badwater Basin, the second-lowest point in the Western Hemisphere and lowest in North America at 282 feet (86 m) below sea level[^1^][13]. A series of Native American groups inhabited the area from as early as 7000 BC, most recently the Timbisha around 1000 AD who migrated between winter camps in the valleys and summer grounds in the mountains[^1^][13]. A group of European Americans, trapped in the valley in 1849 while looking for a shortcut to the gold fields of California, gave the valley its name, even though only one of their group died there[^1^][13].</p>

    <h2>Major Attractions</h2>
    <h3>Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes</h3>
    <p>Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes are a must-see attraction in Death Valley National Park. Named after the mesquite tree, the area’s dunes are created by the wind which steadily moves the sand and the mountains, which keep the sand from being blown too far[^3^][18].</p>

    <h3>Zabriskie Point</h3>
    <p>Zabriskie Point is a part of Amargosa Range located in east of Death Valley noted for its erosional landscape. It is composed of sediments from Furnace Creek Lake, which dried up 5 million years ago—long before Death Valley came into existence[^4^][9].</p>
